The response deadline has been extended for the survey "<%=@survey.job_title%>". Results should be available in <%=better_time_ago_in_words(@survey.end_date)%>.

If you would like to edit your response, go to: <%= @recipient.is_a?(ExternalSurveyInvitation) ? survey_login_path(:survey_id => @survey.id, :key => @recipient.key, :only_path => false) : url_for(survey_path(@survey, :only_path => false))%>
