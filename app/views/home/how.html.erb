  <p>CompSage is built around the understanding that compensation data is most relevant and useful when 
    you can ask <em>exactly the questions you need</em> and when you know <em>exactly who reported the data</em>. This
    allows you to target your survey to specific industries, geographical regions, specific organizations, or anything else
    you need.</p>
  <h3>Becoming a member</h3>
  <p>Becoming a member of CompSage is entirely free of charge and without obligation. We require membership to sponsor
    surveys to ensure the integrity of your data.  To ensure that membership information is accurate, we personally
    verify the details provided on our <%=link_to "sign up form", has_key? ? new_account_path() : signup_path()%>.</p>
  <h3>Sponsoring a survey</h3>

  <p>Sponsoring a survey allows you to create a customized online compensation survey using our standard questions or
    questions of your own design. We also provide a means to allow you to get more details about a certain practice. Sponsoring a survey is no risk and you'll only be billed via credit card or invoice when a report is made
    available.</p>
  <h3>Invite your peers to respond</h3>

  <p>CompSage allows you to choose who responds to your survey. You provide contacts' email addresses, names, or choose networks of peers you have created. We then notify them to respond.</p>
  <h3>Gather data</h3>

  <p>Your peers have a few days to respond to your survey. During this time, they may ask for clarification and
    pose questions about the survey.  We provide means to assure the integrity and <%= link_to "legality", home_path('about')%> of the collected data. Once the participation deadline has passed, a report will be generated. If not
    enough data has been gathered to report data anonymously, you will be given the opportunity to re-run the
    survey.</p>
  <h3>See the results</h3>

  <p>Once the participation deadline has passed, CompSage will present a concise and organized graphical report to you and peers who
    provided data for the survey. Each report can be viewed in a browser or downloaded for Microsoft Word, Excel and PDF format. Data security and integrity is guaranteed.</p>
